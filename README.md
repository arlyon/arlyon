### Hello!

My name is Alex, I am a London-based, open source enthusiast. In the past I have worked in build engineering, healthtech, and most recently consulting. In addition to that, I am also a member of the stripe expert community and hack on [arlyon/async-stripe](https://github.com/arlyon/async-stripe). If you're in London (or ATX) and want to chat about open source, programming, or healthcare, get in touch!
